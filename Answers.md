Answers to the questions

1) exploring project
a) git ignore file locations: home/; home/server; home/client; 
b) there are multiple files because there are multiple gradle tasks
involve a run function, so it needs specific build files for each of these.

2) client
a) Some of the new tools for testing the client would be located
in the other folder and there is a runClientTests option.  There appears
to be a test involving Yarn.

b) The navbar does not use links like a traditional website would, but utilizes
angular so it can be used like a program and never leave the page.  The SparkJava server
appears to be the only thing doing the routing.

3) Todo API: Redux
discussion: we're gonna just copy and some code mkay.
